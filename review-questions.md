Q: You're just starting out as a product owner for an agile team. The first week a project manager gives you a bulleted list of project requirements. She says, "why don't you copy this into a spreadsheet, and then we'll use it for the product backlog?" This is a good example of:
A: Approaching agile as a set of practices instead of a new way of thinking about your product
E: Copying over project requirements into user stories puts too much emphasis on the practice of writing stories but not enough emphasis on the agile mindset.

Q: You're a senior manager and you're in charge of updating your bank's software. The director for this project has been with the company for decades. This director started out as a developer in a programming language called Fortran. Now the team is using a newer language called Python. When you meet with the director they say, "we could do that in Fortran, but I'm not sure it could be done in Python." After a few failed meetings you want to meet directly with the development team so that they can answer your questions. What's the key challenge you're trying to overcome?
A: No director could specialize in all the technology that goes into a modern software product
E: Modern software projects require many developers with a variety of different skills. It's very unlikely that anyone manager will be able to master all of the skills of the developers on the team. So here the manager might want to encourage the team to self-organize and come up with solutions.

Q: What's the best way to describe the cone of uncertainty?
A: You must make decisions early when you know the least about how things will turn out
E: It costs the least to plan and make changes at the very beginning of the cone of uncertainty, but unfortunately that's when you know the least about what it will take to deliver the product. As your team goes further into the cone, it becomes more expensive to make changes, but at the same time the team becomes clearer on how it will deliver the product.

Q: Principles 1, 8, 9 and 10 of the Agile Manifesto describe prioritizing high-value work. What's a common way that agile teams prioritize their work?
A: They create a ranked list of what the customer finds valuable
S: Agile teams work on the highest value items first. This is different from other software development practices that encourage teams to work on what's most technically challenging or take the longest to develop. Agile teams typically have a representative of product owner who ranks all of the products functions and features by customer value.

Q: In a meeting, your managing director passes out a copy of the Agile Manifesto. They said that agile teams are better at developing software. So you should read the printout and then work together as an agile team. What's one of the challenges with this approach?
A: The Agile Manifesto describes a mindset and not a practical way of working
S: The Agile Manifesto is written in a way that encourages teams to embrace a certain mindset. It doesn't outline a practical way of working like you see in project management or manufacturing.

Q: What's the best definition of an agile team?
A: It's a team that embraces a mindset that's consistent with the Agile Manifesto
S: Agile teams embrace a mindset that's consistent with the values and principles outlined in the Agile Manifesto.
